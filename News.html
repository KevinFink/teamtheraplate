		    <h2>TheraPlate Revolution Named Official Therapy Plate of
		        the United States Equestrian Federation</h2>

		<p>Weatherford, Texas (July 21, 2015)– TheraPlate Revolution
		is proud to announce that it is now the Official Therapy
		Plate of the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF).
		TheraPlates are highly effective therapy platforms that use
		dynamic movement to improve fitness, help relieve the causes
		of pain, and foster healing in horses, humans, and other
		animals.</p>

	  <p> “The USEF is pleased to welcome TheraPlate Revolution as
    the Official Therapy Plate of the United States Equestrian
    Federation,” says USEF CEO Chris Welton.  “We look forward to
    TheraPlate’s support of the USEF, and know that TheraPlate’s effective
    therapy platforms will make it an ideal partner for the USEF.”</p>

    <p> As the Official Therapy Plate of the USEF, TheraPlate Revolution
    is providing each of the United States Equestrian Teams a TheraPlate
    to use as the teams train for the 2016 Olympics in Rio.</p>

    <p> Chip Kreiling, owner and founder of TheraPlate Revolution,
    explains that his company has teamed up with the USEF because
    TheraPlate’s therapy platforms enhance an equestrian competitor’s
    program in three ways.</p>

    <p> “First, the TheraPlate maximizes performance— including recovery
    from the stresses of high-level competition,” Kreiling says.  “Next,
    it allows horses to return to competition sooner after injuries by
    reducing healing time.  Finally, it reduces the chances of the horse
    becoming injured as the muscular and connected ligaments and tendons
    become more fit, as fit horses are far less likely to become
    injured.”</p>

    <p> TheraPlate’s platforms gently and rapidly help users reach ideal
    body conditions, with zero impact.  By simply standing on the
    platforms, users can increase blood circulation, build muscle,
    reduce inflammation, and incur many other health benefits.  Adding
    a TheraPlate to a training program can enhance conditioning and
    performance much more quickly than can be done without using the
    therapy platform.</p>

    <p> “Our company is in the business of helping horses heal,” Kreiling
    adds.  “The success of our customers’ horses speaks for itself as
    to how valuable a TheraPlate can be.”</p>

    <p> Not only horses may benefit from the TheraPlate Revolution—
    people can also use the technology themselves for a variety of
    ailments from foot, leg, and back pain management, to osteoporosis,
    fibromyalgia, and Parkinson’s disease.</p>

    <p> “There are not many products you can buy for your horse that
    you will use as much for yourself as you do for your horse,” Kreiling
    says.</p>

    <p> By becoming the Official Therapy Platform of the USEF, TheraPlate
    Revolution’s goal, Kreiling says, is to put a therapy platform in
    the barn of every performance horse in the United States.  The
    Texas-based company feels that the country’s best horses should not
    be without the best technology for therapy, body conditioning,
    healing, and injury prevention.</p>

    <p> “If you compete or own a saddle, you should have a TheraPlate,”
    states Kreiling.  “It doesn't cost much more than a good saddle,
    which often can only be used on one horse— but one TheraPlate will
    work on every horse in the barn!” The USEF and TheraPlate Revolution
    invite all equestrians to step up to the plate by providing their
    horses with an easy and affordable way to attain fitness and
    healing.</p>

    <p> Many of the United States’s top equestrians are already dedicated
    TheraPlate users, including champion Grand Prix show jumper Todd
    Minikus, top dressage riders Heather Blitz and Caroline Roffman,
    11-Time World Champion Barrel Racer Charmayne James, successful
    para-equestrians Sydney Collier and Annie Peavy, and reining champion
    Tom McCutcheon.  These riders use TheraPlate therapy platforms as
    a vital part of their horses’ conditioning and training programs.</p>
