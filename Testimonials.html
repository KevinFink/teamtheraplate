      <div class="testimonial">
			  My mare Elf had a negative-plane coffin bone
				  rotation in Quarantine during her journey to the
				  US from Germany.  Being an Alpha mare and amazingly
				  not showing signs of lameness, we did not discover
				  this until months after her arrival, after she
				  kept having minor bouts of colic (obviously from
				  pain and stress :( ).  When we discovered this,
				  the negative-plane coffin bone rotation was sitting
				  on the non-existent sole of her foot, ready to
				  push through.  I about threw up when I saw this
				  on the x-rays.  We immediately took her barefoot
				  (not an easy task in the PNW heading into wet
				  season!), knocked out a wall creating a stall/paddock
				  for her, put her into the RX boots, with various
				  wedges, and started her on aggressive Theraplate
				  therapy.  Now when I say aggressive, I have to
				  say she was SO sensitive she could not personally
				  tolerate the laminitis protocol, it was too strong
				  for her.  But we did get her on the Theraplate
				  multiple times per day.  Even with the lesser
				  protocol we still got the desired results, which
				  speaks volumes to what that increased
				  circulation/bloodflow does for the health of the
				  hoof at any degree!  Over time her sensitivity
				  decreased, and at this point she can tolerate
				  every level on the Theraplate.  From Oct to Dec
				  2nd she had leveled the coffin bone and grown 3/4
				  inch of hoof!  Some barefoot experts that reviewed
				  these xrays were shocked at her progress in such
				  a very short timeframe!  That is a lot of sole
				  growth in a short period of time.  She has continued
				  to progress in the right direction ever since!
				  She would not have healed this well if not for
				  the Theraplate.  The Theraplate paid for itself
				  in this horse alone!

    <div class="testimonial">Although we purchased
			our TheraPlate for the horses at our stable, all of us
			humans use it as well.  I have observed that when I do
			my morning push-ups on the TheraPlate I am much less
			sore the next day!

		  <p>I have always been in reasonably good shape, and at times
			had very strong legs (I rode my bicycle hundreds of
		  miles per week while in graduate school), but have always
		  had a pretty weak upper body.  Over the years I have
		  periodically attempted to work out, but always had a hard
		  time keeping it going.  A big part of that was pain - I
		  would inevitably do a bunch of exercises (like push-ups),
		  then be in severe pain for the next couple of days and
		  not be able to do anything at all.  By the time the pain
		  was gone, I had lost my momentum and was starting all
		  over again (and so usually didn't...).</p>

      <div style="float:right">
        <img src="/pictures/pushup_graph_20140901.png" width=432 height=318 />
      </div>

		  <p>On various occasions I have tried doing push-ups on our
		  TheraPlate, but again, didn't keep it up.  There would
		  be a horse on it, or I'd go on a business trip, or whatever.
		  However, the biggest obstacle, being in pain the next
		  day, was never an issue.  So a couple weeks ago (July
		  24th, 2014) I decided to try again.  Like I said, I've
		  always had a pretty weak upper body, so I started with
		  what I could do - 25 push-ups each morning after morning
		  check (6 am hay feeding when I make sure all of the horses
		  are ok).  Over the past couple of weeks I think I have
		  done really well - I haven't done them every morning, but
		  almost, and I've more than doubled the number I can do
		  (60 the last two mornings).  And most importantly (being
		  the big wimp I am), no pain!  My chest muscles are
		  definitely fatigued, but they are just tired, not sore,
		  and obviously I'm building and/or toning muscle, as I'm
		  able to do a lot more than when I started.</p>

		  <p>A couple weeks before I started this regular program, I
		  overheard my wife telling someone about how the TheraPlate
		  keeps me from being sore after push-ups, which was
		  definitely true, but with a "slight" exaggeration - she
		  said something about doing 100 push-ups and not being
		  sore.  At that point I could barely do 25, and couldn't
		  imagine I could ever get up to 100, as never in all of
		  the years I've tried to work out had I ever been able to
		  do that many at once.  With my new-found success, however,
		  I'm taking that as a challenge.  My goal is to make it
		  up to 100 per day by my birthday: September 10th.  So
		  far, so good - thanks TheraPlate!</p>

      <p><strong>Update: 01 Sep 2014</strong><br/>
		     As you can see from the graph, I have made it up to my
		     goal of 100 push-ups per day!  I plan on keeping going,
		     but now I'm focusing on doing more per set (the last two
		     days I did 30 in the first set, then 15-25 in subsequent
		     sets, depending on how long I rested between sets).
