	  Much of our personal experience with the TheraPlate is specific
	  to horses.  We purchased one for our boarding stable, <a
	  href="http://www.traumhofdressage.com/">Traumhof</a>, several
	  years ago (fall of 2011).  At first we were quite nervous
	  about whether the horses would stand on it, as we had previous
	  bad experiences with a similar product made by a different
	  company.  (We tried to use it on two of our horses while they
	  were training at a different barn, and even after three months
	  they would never stand quietly on it.) However, it quickly
	  became clear that the motion of the TheraPlate feels
	  very different, as both of those horses, as well as virtually
	  every other one we've tried on it since, very quickly got
	  used to it.  In fact, after the first session or two almost
	  every one eagerly steps up and stands happily.  Many find it
	  so relaxing they drowse off while on it!
    </p>

    <p>
	  Most of our experience with the TheraPlate revolves around
	  therapy.  Our original focus was on helping the healing of
	  leg injuries (tendon tears, muscle pulls, etc), and it has
	  proven valuable over and over in that area.  We also started
	  noticing, and then taking more advantage of, it's benefits
	  for hoof problems.  Originally this was due to improvements
	  we saw in hoof health in horses that were using it for rehab
	  from leg problems.  For example, Danny was on it for a tendon
	  problem, but it ended up having an arguably bigger impact on
	  his overall health due to its effect on his hooves.  He had
	  problems with exuberant granulation for many, many years.
	  The farriers were managing it, but his feet were often sore.
	  After about a month of TheraPlate treatment, healthy tissue
	  grew on his feet to such a degree that the entire plate of
	  granulation fell off the bottom, leaving just healthy hoof.
	  The farrier was amazed!
    </p>

    <p>
		  We have since had several other cases where the TheraPlate
		  accelerated hoof growth significantly.  We have also heard
		  similar stories from farms who have purchased the TheraPlate
		  on our recommendation.  One case involved a stallion who
		  was in a major barn fire.  He had bad burns over much of
		  his body, and the treatment for them had the unfortunate
		  side effect of damaging his feet.  When we first saw him,
		  about 18 months after the fire, his hooves were still
		  bandaged and he could barely walk.  The owner wanted to
		  try a TheraPlate as a last-ditch effort, as nothing else
		  seemed to be helping.  Within two weeks of starting him
		  on it, he was already doing much better - the bandages
		  were off and he could walk comfortably.  After a month
		  he could be lunged at the trot, and last we heard he was
	    back to full work!
    </p>

    <p>
	    Another unexpected, but very welcome, benefit of the TheraPlate
		  that we discovered concerns colic.  Here in the Pacific
		  Northwest we see (and hear about) a lot of colic issues.
	    Most of these are minor and easily resolved, but unfortunately
		  some do require surgical intervention and a few end up
		  being fatal.  We suspect the frequent and sometimes severe
		  swings in temperature and barometric pressure play a role,
		  although no one knows for sure.  In any case, we monitor
		  the horses in our care very closely for colic to minimize
		  the chances of needing a more significant intervention.
		  Historically, our typical response to a horse showing
		  signs of colic (not finishing their feed, not drinking
		  as much water as normal, not pooping as much as usual,
		  showing signs of intestinal distress or pain, reduced gut
		  sounds, etc) was to give them a large dose of DynaPro (a
		  pre-biotic -- to help the gut processes) and hand-walk
		  them.  Depending on the severity of the symptoms we would
		  usually call a vet immediately, as well, who would typically
		  administer fluids and oil.  Usually this is sufficient
		  and the horse starts to manure within the next 12-24 hours
		  and is back to regular routines within a couple of days.
	</p>

    <p>
	    Since acquiring the TheraPlate, we have modified our protocol
	    to include it.  At the first signs of colic we administer the
	    DynaPro and immediately put them on the TheraPlate.  In cases
	    of gas colic this is often enough - the combination of direct
	    vibration, the calming effect on the horse, and relaxation
	    of gut muscles due to both of those seems to help the horse
	    pass the gas and manure.  Even in cases of mild impaction the
	    horse will often manure during that first session.
    </p>

    <p>
	    If that doesn't completely resolve the issue, we will usually
	    call the vet and continue to alternate hand-walking with
		  TheraPlate sessions.  In every case we see some improvement
		  by the time the vet arrives, and in most cases significant
		  improvement (one half-jokingly told us not to bother to
		  call him after 10 pm anymore if we were going to put them
		  on it).  The vet usually tubes the horse to get fluids,
		  oil, and sometimes medicine into them, and tells us not to
		  expect much manure before morning.  We often run them through
		  the TheraPlate colic protocol one more time, and in more
		  cases than not, see multiple piles before morning, surprising
		  the vet (the first couple of times - now they're getting
		  used to it...).
	</p>

    <p>
		  While most of our personal experience is on the therapeutic
		  use of the TheraPlate, many other people we know use
		  theirs primarily for training.  Several high-profile
		  dressage trainers use theirs to warm and loosen the horse's
		  muscles before riding them - several by tacking up the
		  horse while it is standing on the TheraPlate.  In addition
		  to saving time, as part of the usual warm-up happens
		  simultaneously with tacking the horse up, they have found
		  that the horse is more relaxed and loose for the ride.
		  One high-level dressage rider, Jessica Jo Tate, observed
		  an immediate improvement in her horses' scores since
		  starting to use the TheraPlate - presumably due to the
		  fact that relaxation and suppleness are important components
		  of dressage scoring.
    </p>

    <p>
		  We also hope that using the TheraPlate before riding
		  decreases the chances of injury during the work-out.
		  Several veterinarian researchers at Colorado State
		  University are testing this hypothesis, as a matter of
		  fact.  They installed a full-stall version of the TheraPlate
		  in the spring of 2014, and will be running studies on
		  performance improvement and injury prevention, as well
		  as its effect on rehabilitation after injuries.  It will
		  be very interesting to see what their studies show to
		  augment the many anecdotal testimonials from happy horse
		  owners.
