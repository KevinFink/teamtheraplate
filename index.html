	<p> Get a free trial from Team TheraPlate, an independent distributor of the
		  TheraPlate Revolution Therapy Platform.  After several
		  years of amazing results at our boarding stable (<a
		  href="http://www.traumhofdressage.com/">Traumhof</a>),
		  we decided to help distribute this great product.  </p>

  <p> The "TheraPlate" utilizes a low-amplitude orbital motion for
		rehabilitation and sports conditioning.  The subject (person,
		horse, dog, cat, etc) simply stands, sits, or lies on the
		platform.  The platform's motion causes the muscles to
		rhythmically contract and release, relaxing the tissues
		while enhancing muscle tone and increasing circulation.
		The increased circulation, in turn, has a plethora of
		benefits, ranging from improved healing rates of many
		soft-tissue injuries to better hoof growth to increasing
		bone density.

			<p>
			  Several sizes of platforms are available, ranging from a 2' x 2'
			  unit for humans and/or small animals to stand on up to a 3' x 7'
			  unit for horses.  Complete details and specifications can be found
			  on the <a href="/Products.html">Products Page</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  Because we believe so strongly in its benefits, and want as many
			  people (and horses and cats and dogs and...) as possible to have
			  access to it, we are offering a free three-week trial at your home
			  or facility.  The unit will be shipped directly to you and we
			  will help you set it up (in person if you're in the Seattle area,
			  on the phone otherwise).  In the unlikely event you decide it's
			  not right for you, we'll have it picked up, all at no cost to
			  you.

			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			
      <div style="float:right; padding: 10px">
        <img class="picture" src="/pictures/Jasmine_Crocs_TheraPlate-225x400.jpg" width="112" height="200" />

			<p>
			  Several years ago (2011) we purchased a TheraPlate
			  to help the rehab horses at <a href="http://www.traumhofdressage.com/">Traumhof</a>
			  maintain muscle tone and bone density and to help them recover
			  from various injuries.  We have been very pleased with the results,
			  not only for these purposes but even more so in other areas.
			  For example, it has helped us resolve many mild colics (and some
			  that appeared quite serious) with little or no vet intervention.
			  It has also helped reduce abcess recurrences in horses with a
			  long history of chronic abcesses, healed hoof granulation where
			  nothing else has helped, and accelerated hoof growth in multiple
			  cases. See our <a href="/Horses.html">Horse Page</a> for more
        details on the benefits of the TheraPlate for horses.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  Various forms of vibration therapy have
        <a href="Studies.html">well-documented track records</a>,
			  with hundreds of peer-reviewed studies, for helping
			  both humans and animals recover from injuries as well
			  as develop and maintain healthy bodies.  We particularly
			  like the TheraPlate's unique 4 Zone Vortex Wave design
			  for its zero impact experience.  Under the rubber top
			  there are four separate metal plates, one for each
			  of the horse's legs.  Each plate is driven in a planar
			  orbital motion by a separate motor.  The controller
			  allows you to vary the frequency of this motion.
			  These fast, tiny motions travel through the entire
			  body, but there is no vertical compression or rocking,
			  so no risk of further injury or aggravating existing
			  conditions.

			  the TheraPlate at Traumhof</div>

			<p> Whether the horses recognize the benefits or just
			  like how it makes them feel, it's clear that they
			  enjoy using the TheraPlate - they eagerly rush to it,
			  step up onto the plate, and stand happily for the
			  duration of their session.  We (and many of our
			  clients, visitors, farriers, etc) also enjoy using
			  the TheraPlate ourselves to help relax sore muscles,
			  tight backs, tired feet, and everything else that
			  comes along with a horse farm!
